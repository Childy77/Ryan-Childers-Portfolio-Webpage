# Ryan-Childers-Portfolio-Webpage

-I created a page with links linking the Contact, About me, and Portfolio connecting to their appropriate areas of the page.

-I put images with links to a plaveholder website so I can change them when I have more pages I create in class.

-I created a picture of me, with a short bio about me.

-I created a colorful background with different linear gradients.

-I tried to make it accesable to mobile devices.

-I have extra selectors in CSS to later make changes when needed.

-I created hover affects over the images.
